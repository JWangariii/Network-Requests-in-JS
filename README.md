## Axios is a promise-based HTTP client. It is designed to make it easier to make HTTP requests and handle responses using promises.

Axios handles JSON data coming from the server by automatically decoding it into a JavaScript object. When the server responds with JSON data, Axios parses it for you, making it easy to work with.
